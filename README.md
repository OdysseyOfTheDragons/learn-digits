# Learn digits

Android application to learn the digits of the most famous mathematical constants.

## Project overview

This project builds an Android application using only C code. The final aim is
to provide a simple application to learn the digits of the most famous
mathematical constants there exists.

## Steps

I want to go down the project a step at a time. The following is a roadmap I
may (or not) follow, as it will depend on the problems and new ideas I will
have on the way.

1. Have a working CLI application to memorize the digits of $\pi$.
2. Modularize the code to add other constants.
3. Add a UI application to do the same, but with GUI.
4. Make it available on Android.

## Mathematical constants

Here are the following constants I plan to support. More could be added on a
later date.

* $\pi$
* Golden ratio $\phi$
* Euler's number $\mathsf{e}$
* Euler's constant $\gamma$
* $\sqrt{2}$
* $\ln 2$

## Features

Some features I want to implement inside the application.

* each mathematical constant should have its [oeis.org](https://oeis.org) number accompanying it, with a link to the online website
* a simple database to keep the user settings
* a simple database to keep the user tries / errors / success
